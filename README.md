## Overview
The **Crop Recommendation AI App** is an intelligent web application designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in selecting the most suitable crop for their land based on specific environmental and soil conditions. This app leverages machine learning, natural language processing, and image search technologies to provide insightful and actionable recommendations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Slider Inputs**:
  Users can input key parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium levels, along with temperature, humidity, and rainfall levels, using an interactive slider-based interface.

- **AI-Powered Crop Analysis**:
  A machine learning model, trained using Pythonâ€™s `sklearn` library on a Kaggle crop dataset, predicts the most suitable crop for the given conditions.

- **Crop Image Search**:
  The app fetches relevant crop images from the internet using the Pixabay API, providing users with a visual reference.

- **Expert Guidance via AI**:
  The Ollama 3.2 model (1-billion parameter NLP model) generates detailed information about the recommended crop, including how to grow and care for it.

## How It Works
1. Navigate to the home page and adjust the sliders to match the soil and environmental conditions of your land.
2. Click the **Analyze** button.
3. The app:
   - Analyzes the input data using the trained ML model.
   - Predicts the best crop to grow.
   - Fetches a representative image of the crop using the Pixabay API.
   - Provides a comprehensive guide on the crop, written by the Ollama NLP model.
